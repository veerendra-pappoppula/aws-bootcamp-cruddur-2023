# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
Learnt about docker and how it is useful for application building, management and deployment. Containerized the application by building separate dockerfiles for backend and frontend and used docker compose to start, install necessary software and test the application in a guest environment.

Created an api for notifications page, backend endpoint and a frontend page for notifications.

Connected to dynamodb and postgresql, made sure they are working. Added steps to install the extension to connect to postgresql db when the gitpod environment spins up.
